## Password Generator

This is a very simple password generator created with JavaScript and Bulma CSS, inspired by a video recently released on Youtube by Traversy Media.

The code is my own even though I did watch the video, and it builds a simple but important functionality to randomize the order of the characters that are returned. This increases the strength of the password by avoiding a repeatable pattern.
